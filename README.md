# LabVIEWforRasPi
This repo includes both the Raspberry Pi image that is to be used in support of the Raspberry Pi Compatible Compiler for LabVIEW and the VI Package Manager (VIPM) LabVIEW packages that are to be installed on the development machine in order to compile and download LabVIEW code to your Raspberry Pi. There are two VIPM files, one is the Home edition and the other the Standard Edition. The two editions have no functionality differences, however, the Compiler License Agreement states the Home edition is to be used only for Home/Academic projects. If a project is for profit, or any sort of commercial application, the Standard edition is required. Make sure to review the details of the Compiler License Agreement to familiarize yourself with the complete terms and conditions for use. The License File is installed along with the Raspberry Pi Compatible Compiler for LabVIEW VIPM package.

Make sure to burn a SD Card with the image provided in this repository as, even though the official Raspberry Pi PIXEL Operating System is maintained untouched, all the necessary support packages have been installed and properly configured so your Raspberry Pi is ready to receive compiled LabVIEW code. 

**A NOTE TO LABVIEW 2016 USERS: MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING THE LATEST VERSION OF VI PACKAGE MANAGER (2016 SP1), OTHERWISE THE COMPILER WILL NOT PROPERLY INSTALL ON YOUR LABVIEW 2016.**
