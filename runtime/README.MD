This directory contains patches to the runtime used for the LabVIEW Compatible Compiler for Raspberry Pi.  Download the latest version to your machine running the GUI.  When connected to a Raspberry Pi choose 'Update Runtime' from the Compiler Menu, select the file from the browser, and then the GUI will connect to the Raspberry Pi and update the runtime.  If the installed runtime is the same or newer you must confirm that you want to overwrite it.
